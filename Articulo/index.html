       <b><h3 id="section1.1">1.1: What are Neural Networks?</h3></b>
       <p>Neural networks are a cool blend of biology and computer science, inspired by our brain's setup to tackle complicated computing tasks. Essentially, they're algorithms designed to spot patterns and make sense of sensory data, which lets them do a ton of stuff like recognizing faces, understanding spoken words, making predictions, and understanding natural language.</p>
       <br>  
       <b><h3>The Biological Inspiration</h3></b>

       <br>
       <p>Our brains have about 86 billion neurons, all linked up in a complex network. These neurons chat through connections called synapses, where signals can get stronger or weaker, influencing the message passed along. This is the foundation of how we learn and remember things.</p>
       <br>
       <p>Artificial neural networks take a page from this book, using digital neurons or nodes that connect in layers. You've got input layers that take in data, hidden layers that chew on this data, and output layers that spit out the result. As the network gets fed more data, it adjusts the connection strengths (or 'weights') to learn, kind of like how our brain's synapses strengthen or weaken.</p>
        <br>
        <b><h3>From Perceptrons to Deep Learning</h3></b>
        <p>Neural networks started with something called a perceptron in 1958, thanks to Frank Rosenblatt. This was a basic neural network meant for simple yes-or-no-type tasks. From there, we built more complex networks, like multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs), which can understand more complicated data relationships thanks to having one or more hidden layers.</p>
        <p>Then came deep learning, which is all about neural networks with lots of layers. These deep neural networks are capable of learning from huge piles of data, and they're behind a lot of the AI breakthroughs we hear about, from beating human Go players to powering self-driving cars.</p>
